# UPDATE 12/09/2018
- This project is finally fixed thanks to [tcmean](https://github.com/tcmean) for the head up about the new KTMB ticket website.
- I was able to find new API from the new website and used it for this project.
- This project is now fully client side application as it does not need to use PHP anymore, as the new API is CORS enabled which allow it to be access cross domain.
